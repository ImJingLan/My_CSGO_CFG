At most levels, different gimmicks will appear as you move forward, and you will need to consult with your peers and think about new ways to cooperate.\r\n\r\nThis version is essentially a port of the one we released on the Nintendo Switch in 2019.\r\nHowever, it's not just a port, it now supports online play.\r\n\r\nThe 2016 version of this link has been renamed  &quot;PICO PARK:Classic Edition&quot;\r\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/461040/PICO_PARKClassic_Edition/\r\n\r\n[Flexible Level]\r\nEach level of PICO PARK can be cleared when players get the key,unlock the door and all players reach it.But, every level requires cooperation to complete..\r\n\r\n[Battle Mode]\r\nCo-op play is the main work of this game, but let's compete with friends in BATTLE MODE once co-op play is completed.\r\n\r\n[Endless Mode]\r\nEven if you complete all 48 stages, you can play ENDLESS mode to aim at high score by collaborating with friends. By collaborating with friends, your score will grow faster.\r\n\r\n[Online Play Mode]\r\nYou can play together online with people who are far away from you. \r\nHowever, this is a game where communication is very important, so we recommend using Discord or Zoom to play while talking.\r\n\r\n[TecoGamePad]\r\nTecoGamePad change your smartphone turn to gamepad (for local play mode)\r\nAndroid:[url]play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=toybox.app.virtual_controller[/url]\r\niOS:[url]itunes.apple.com/us/app/tecogamepad/id1080510485[/url]\r\n\r\nLet's have fun playing PICO PARK with your friends!","strSnippet":"PICO PARK is a cooperative local/online multiplay action puzzle game for 2-8 players."}}]]
